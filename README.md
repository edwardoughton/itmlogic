Longley-Rice Irregular Terrain Model 

**itmlogic** is a Python implementation of the Longley-Rice propagation model 
(v1.2.2) and capable of estimating the propagation effects resulting from 
irregular terrain.

Model properties and the algorithm defining it are available in:

* Hufford, G. A., A. G. Longley, and W. A. Kissick (1982), A guide    to the use of the ITS Irregular Terrain Model in the area   
  prediction mode, NTIA Report 82-100. (NTIS Order No. PB82-217977)

* Hufford, G. A. (1995) The ITS Irregular Terrain Model, version   
  1.2.2, the Algorithm.
